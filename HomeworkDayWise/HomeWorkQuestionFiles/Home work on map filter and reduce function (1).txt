1) Given an array of strings, count the number of times each string appears and return an object with the string as the key and the count as the value.
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'apple'];
// Expected Output: { apple: 3, banana: 2, orange: 1 }

2) Given an array of numbers, create a new array that contains the squares of each number.
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

3) Given an array of numbers, find the product of all the elements in the array.
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

4) Given an array of numbers, create a new array that contains the squares of only the odd numbers.
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

5) Given an array of objects representing products with a price property, calculate the total cost of all products after applying a 10% discount.
const products = [
{ name: 'Product 1', price: 100 },
{ name: 'Product 2', price: 200 },
{ name: 'Product 3', price: 300 }
];

//Expected Output: 540


6) Find Longest Word
From ["sun", "moon", "stars", "galaxy"], use reduce to find the longest word.

7) Extract Names from Objects
const users = [
  { name: "Amit", age: 20 },
  { name: "Neha", age: 25 },
  { name: "Raj", age: 30 }
];
Filter Adults
From the above users array, use filter to get people with age >= 25.

8) 
You are given an array of student records:
const students = [
  { name: "Amit", marks: [80, 75, 90] },
  { name: "Neha", marks: [95, 88, 92] },
  { name: "Raj", marks: [45, 50, 40] },
  { name: "Pooja", marks: [70, 72, 68] },
  { name: "Karan", marks: [30, 35, 28] }
];

A) Calculate Total Marks
Use map + reduce to calculate each student’s total marks.

B) Add total and average to Each Student

Use map to return a new array where each student object also has a total and average property.
Example : { name: "Amit", marks: [80, 75, 90], total: 245, average: 81.6 }

C) Filter Passing Students
Consider passing if average ≥ 50.
Use filter to get only the passing students.

D)Class Topper
Use reduce to find the student with the highest total marks.

E) Class Average Marks
Use reduce to calculate the overall class average.

F) List of Student Names (Uppercase)
Use map to create an array of student names in uppercase.
