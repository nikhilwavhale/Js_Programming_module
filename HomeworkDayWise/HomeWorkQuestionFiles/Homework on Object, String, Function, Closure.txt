Object

Try modifying the properties and adding a new one.

Observe whether the changes reflect.

Q2. Car Information (Object.seal)

Create a car object with properties: brand, model, and year.

Q3. Product with Special Property (Object.defineProperty)

Create a product object with properties: id and name.

Use Object.defineProperty() to add a price property:

writable: false (cannot be changed)

Test the behaviour by trying to update and delete the price property.

String
Q1. Write a program that processes a sentence string and performs the following operations:

Take a sentence (e.g., "JavaScript is a powerful programming language").

Use slice() to extract the word "powerful".

Use split() to break the sentence into an array of words.

Use includes() to check if the word "JavaScript" exists in the sentence.

Use indexOf() to find the position of the word "language" in the sentence.

Function
Q1. Create an arrow function called square that takes a number as an argument and returns its square. Use
the arrow function to calculate the square of a given number and display the result.

Q2. Create an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that calculates the square of a number and
immediately displays the result.

Q3. Write a JavaScript function called calculateTax that takes an income as an argument and returns the
amount of tax to be paid. Use a closure to handle different tax rates based on income ranges. Test the
function with various incomes.

**************************************************************************************************
Closure

Q1. Write a JavaScript function called outerFunction that takes a parameter and returns an inner function.
The inner function should access both the parameter of outerFunction and a variable declared within
outerFunction. Demonstrate how lexical scoping allows the inner function to maintain access to these
variables even after outerFunction has finished executing.
